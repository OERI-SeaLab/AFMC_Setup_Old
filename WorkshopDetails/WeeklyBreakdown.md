## Notes

Each day aims to balance theory with hands-on practice and leave room for reflection and feedback. Participants need to pace themselves, as learning is a marathon, not a sprint and this information is a lot to absorb as we are going to be jumping between a few different environments rather quickly at times between Microsoft setup and Unity that alone is a lot to take in, then the HMD and the entire UX around that is a lot as well.

I also want to try to find a way to maintain this conversation with the group - hence the use of GitHub. I think running the project as an Open Source contribution aligns really well and gives them a chance to reach back out through the repository for additional questions.
