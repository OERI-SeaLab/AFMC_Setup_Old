** Notes: For me it's important to convey to all roles in a project dealing with mixed reality the importance of dedicated physical space, dedicated computer resources, and understanding that interactions and user experience within this environment can be done on a computer for most of it - but to really build out a well encompassed experience it's vitally important to have adequate testing and physical space configuration to do said testing.

I want to try and make sure we effectively communicate any specific needs or concerns they might have and sort of curb any sort of expectations up-front. Day 1 is setup. We can have some stuff done prior but I want them thinking about what they might need for their own testing. If they are just using the equipment to haphazardly look at points in 3D space they need to not be doing this, they need to be in VR and they need to be upfront with their administration. If they want to fully understand and get into a mixed reality experience it's equal physical UX coming to grips. Air pointing and clicking is great for a minute, try doing it for 20 minutes... By the end of the day we will be in the headset, but the physical and mental actions of physically doing the setup is something that I do every time now before any large mixed reality project and it has greatly helped me understand and sort of 'dwell' in that space. It also helps underline the significance of the first day's activities in relation to the rest of the workshop.

**Subject:** Welcome to the [What are we calling this workshop again?]: Preparation for Monday.

**Body:**

Dear [Group name/lab person etc.],

We are excited to welcome you to our [workshop name again] that starts this Monday, July 10th.

On Monday we will be particularly hands-on, as well as most of the week, but Monday we are going to be putting a focus on setting up our co-working space for the week. This will involve configuring our physical location as in our experience having dedicated physical testing space can be vitally important to address up front. We also will be using the day to configure the various standard software for the HoloLens; specifically spending some time in Visual Studio and Unity3D.

As we will be moving around and possibly handling equipment, we suggest you dress in comfortable clothing suitable for these activities.

Below is an overview of our activities for Monday:

- Welcome & Introduction (Outline the goals for the day)
- Building out our space for the week: things to consider for a development space for mixed reality.
- Understanding HoloLens 2 Hardware and initial device setup
- Introduction to Visual Studio and Unity3D. Setting up the software.
- Hands-on: Try out some different examples via Unity/Microsoft and further extension of setting up the software

This day for us is as much about getting to know the equipment as it is about getting to know each other and understanding our own co-working space and the contribution that the physical space can have on the entire process. We really want to offer an opportunity to get everyone to participate within this processes as for us this process is essential for a smooth start to the [workshop name].

We want to also make sure we are committed to creating an inclusive and accessible environment for everyone. If you have any specific needs, requirements, or concerns about any of the work we are doing - at any point - just let us know! We want to particularly emphasis that for the first day it's really about setting everything up, getting to know everyone, and building our space to include everyone to be part of that space. Please do not hesitate to contact us directly. We are here to ensure you have a positive and productive experience throughout the week!

The physical setup of our co-working space is an integral part of the mixed reality development process. Unlike typical software work, mixed reality development requires us to test different scenarios in various physical spaces and with different interactions, gestures, other uses of equipment, and in our opinion is a key part of understanding the entire process. While we'll actively be setting up the workspace on the first day, understanding the importance and requirements of such a dedicated space is crucial for the rest of the week's activities.
