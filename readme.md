# Weekly Breakdown

* Note: For us it's crucial to structure the workshop in a way that balances both the learning aspect and the hands-on experience. Right now Thursday & Friday are dedicated to expanding upon what we cover in the first three days, that being said we are also going to open up those days more with the groups overall needs as we get half-way through the week: if you all as a group would rather use those days for us to work on specific applications needs and/or work on building out a potential plan to help specific use cases we will be more than welcome to open that up. Here's the current detailed structure for the day:

## Monday

### Setup and Configuration

* 9-10: Welcome, Introduction, GitHub Access, and Day 1 Goals Outline

* Small Break - coffee/restroom
* 11-12: Understanding HoloLens 2 Hardware and initial device setup
  * Hopefully convey it's a technological impressive headset, still not fully there on long term usability, and some fantastic developer hardware to prepare for the next few years.
* 12-1: Lunch Break
* 1-3: Introduction to Unity and HoloLens 2 examples: configuring Visual Studio for Remote Build

## Notes

Each day aims to balance theory with hands-on practice and leave room for reflection and feedback. Participants need to pace themselves, as learning is a marathon, not a sprint and this information is a lot to absorb as we are going to be jumping between a few different environments rather quickly at times between Microsoft setup and Unity that alone is a lot to take in, then the HMD and the entire UX around that is a lot as well.

I also want to try to find a way to maintain this conversation with the group - hence the use of GitHub. I think running the project as an Open Source contribution aligns really well and gives them a chance to reach back out through the repository for additional questions.
